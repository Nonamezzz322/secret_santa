Every day a lot of people come to the site and from time to time there may be interruptions in work due to high load. We are working on fixing the situation, but we cannot guarantee 100% stability at the moment. Please understand with understanding - the site is free. If the error persists for several hours, please write to support@secret-santa.ru with a detailed description of the problem, probably, it is not related to the load."

          "answer": "There is no limitation on the number of participants at the moment. However, with a very large number of participants (somewhere over 500), the box page may slow down. Also, letters will be sent out longer."

          "question": "What is the minimum number of people needed to draw?",

        {
          "question": "I am the organizer, I invited the participants through the table, but the invitations did not reach, what should I do?",
          "answer": "On the invitation page there is an option to 'Send invitations together with the results of the draw', you probably forgot to turn it off before sending the invitations. You can: 1 - draw lots and invitations will be sent along with a link to the ward; 2 - remove all participants and invite them again by turning off the 'Send invitations together with the results of the draw' option."

          "question": "After the drawing of lots, it turned out that the email address of the participant was incorrect, what should I do?",
          "answer": "At the moment, there is no way on the site to change the participant's address after the drawing of lots, such an opportunity will appear in the new version, but for now, you can write to me at support@secret-santa.ru with a request to correct the address. Send the following information: incorrect email followed by the correct one (please specify which one is correct in any case)."

You need to go to the box under the account under which you created the box and then you will see the pages for the organizer. To see who is the organizer of the box, go to the 'My boxes' page and see who is listed as the organizer opposite the box name on the right (if this is you, then you will not see the inscription, but under the box name there will be the inscription 'organizer')"
